# Shopping-Cart-Project
Shopping Cart Project - NYU

This is my version of the shopping cart program exercise. 

Fork the repository and create a virtual environment
    conda create -n shopping-env python=3.7

Then run the program
    python shoppingcart.py

Enter in the ID number for each product you wish to purchase, then type Done when finished.
